# Face Liveness Detection

# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Face and Eye Detection for Liveness Detection, aiming to differentiate between real and spoofed faces using computer vision techniques. The system detects facial features and determines liveness based on movement and blink detection.

# ✨ Features

Real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV.

Liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks.

Integration with deep learning models for enhanced security.

Efficient and lightweight implementation suitable for real-time applications.

# 🚀 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Prerequisites

# Ensure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.7)

OpenCV

NumPy

dlib

imutils

Steps

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/PRACHIRATHORE07/Face_Liveness_Detection_SIH.git
cd Face_Liveness_Detection_SIH/Eye-Face_Detection-main

# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the face detection script

python face_detection.py

# 🛠️ Usage Instructions

Run the main script to start real-time face detection.

The system will detect faces and eyes using OpenCV and dlib.

If a real person is detected, the liveness score will be updated based on eye blinks and movement.

The results will be displayed in real-time with bounding boxes.

# 🔧 Technologies Used

Python for scripting and processing

OpenCV for image processing

Dlib for facial landmark detection

NumPy for numerical computations
